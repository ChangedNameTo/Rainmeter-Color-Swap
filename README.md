# Rainmeter-Color-Swap
Used to change the colors for ForceX2 System Monitor in a GUI.

You will need to change out the file paths using a replace command to adapt it to your personal rainmeter setup. At the current time it only works with a system monitoring skin but it is being worked on to apply to a cohesive set of skins.
